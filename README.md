# BRender Source Code, Croc version

Now that the [BRender source code](https://github.com/foone/BRender-v1.3.2) has been released,
I can now release the copies used in the various Croc DE versions.

These are copied straight out of the Croc source tree.

A sample CMake project, two BRender tools (`mkranges` and `mkshades`), and the OS/2 Robot
example application have been provided to demonstrate usage of the engine.

Enjoy!
